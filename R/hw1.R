#' Homework 1 Data
#'
#' The hw1.sav dataset contains data on college studentsâ€™ responses to a substance abuse questionnaire. Items on the questionnaire asked students about their use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana as well as questions on childhood abuse and neglect, family issues (i.e., conflict, communication), sense of support/belonging, and anxiety. Demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, class level) of the participants were also collected. **Note**: higher values for the continuous variables in this dataset represent higher levels of the variable.
