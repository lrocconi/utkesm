\usage{

\arguments{
\item{x}{Model object}
}
\value{
Returns the Relative Efficiency (RE) statistic for the variables included in the model
}
\description{

\note{
formula 10.4 Heymans, M. W. (2019). Applied Missing Data Analysis with SPSS and (R)Studio. https://bookdown.org/mwheymans/bookmi/measures-of-missing-data-information.html

The close to 1 the better. Itâ€™s based on the fraction of missing information and the number of imputation, so the larger the amount of missing data, the greater number of imputation needed. RE = 1/(1+(FMI/m)).
